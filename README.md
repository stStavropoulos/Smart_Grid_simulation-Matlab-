# Smart_Grid_simulation
This is a repository about the Smart grid simulation with the utilization of numerical methods.
The results can be converted into a fixed point representation and be stored in files so that they can be analyzed by Vivado.
For the understanding of the symbols and the calculations that are taking place in the code, I suggest you to check the bibliography I uploaded.
