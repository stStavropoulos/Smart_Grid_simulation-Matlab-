# Smart_Grid_simulation
This is a repository regarding Smart grid simulation with the utilization of numerical methods.
The results converted into a fixed-point representation and were stored in files, so that they can be analyzed by Vivado.
For the understanding of the symbols and the calculations that are taking place in the code, I suggest you to check the bibliography I uploaded.

For simplification of the differential equations describing the function of microgrid's components, I employed the trapezoidal rule:
